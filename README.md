# TSP_with_genetic_algorithm
Traveling salesman problem with genetic algorithm

The objective of this project is to implement genetic algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and analyze the different types of configurations to optimize the algorithm for the best fitness. The goal for this problem is minimization where the shortest possible route distance between all the cities from a list fits the best solution.
